Title: Core improvements

----

Text:

- `site` controller data will now always be merged as default data with data from page template specific controllers.https://feedback.getkirby.com/422
- New `files.sort` permission [#1969](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/1969)

#### UUIDs
- Duplicating pages: All UUIDs within the copied page, its files and children that point to an object that got copied as - well will be replaced with the UUID of the copied version. If no copying files, any UUID pointing to a file within the copied page gets removed. [#6567](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6567)
- UUIDs are fully lowercased now to avoid issues between filesystems handling casing differently [#6566](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6566)
